# Discord OAuth2 Roles System
A user-friendly web interface authenticated with OAuth2 to assign and manage Discord roles on college community servers. 

- Utilizes Discord's v6 HTTPS/REST API.
- Back-end REST API written in TypeScript, using Deno server and oak.
- Front-end client written in HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript without additional dependencies.
- Accompanied with my [state-of-the-art Discord bot](https://github.com/JAVAB3ANS/scu-discord-bot).
